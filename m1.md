# Installation Issue

I had trouble importing atari games via gym.
Atari games needed ROM license, but some dependency error occurred.
I was able to resolve this issue reading through https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/3170.

Following commands resolved the issue.

```bash
pip install autorom
AutoROM --accept-license
```

```bash
